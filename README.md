## Introduction
"Prevent Hate" is my first assessed portfolio project, developed as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp. This project demonstrates my ability to utilise HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap  and Copilot to create a responsive and user-friendly website. The goal was to meet the requirements of a brief focused on raising awareness about safeguarding against extremism and radicalisation.

The website is designed to provide a clear introduction to the UK’s Prevent strategy, helping users understand how to recognise risks, respond effectively, and access the right support. With a focus on simplicity and accessibility, "Prevent Hate" reflects my commitment to creating meaningful and impactful web solutions.



## Project Outline

The Prevent Hate website is designed to raise awareness about safeguarding against extremism and radicalisation by introducing the UK’s Prevent strategy. The project aims to deliver a clear, accessible, and user-focused platform that meets both the needs of users seeking information and the goals of the Prevent initiative.

# Objective #
Raise Awareness: Educate users on the fundamentals of the Prevent strategy and its role in safeguarding.
Inform and Empower: Provide practical advice on recognising the signs of radicalisation and responding appropriately.
Support Users: Offer a clear pathway to access help, resources, and reporting mechanisms.

## Project Planning
he Prevent Hate website was carefully planned to ensure it meets the needs of its users and aligns with its goals of raising awareness about safeguarding and extremism.

1. Defining Objectives
The project planning began with identifying the primary objectives:
* To provide a clear and concise introduction to the Prevent strategy.
* To offer actionable steps for recognising and responding to radicalisation.
* To make resources and reporting mechanisms easily accessible.
2. Understanding the User
User personas were developed to ensure the website meets user needs effectively:
* General Public: Individuals unfamiliar with Prevent who want to learn about it.
* Parents: Concerned about safeguarding their children from online or offline radicalisation.
* Community Workers/Educators: Seeking guidance on recognising and responding to warning signs.
3. Content Organisation
The website was divided into three key pages:
* Home Page: Introduces the Prevent strategy and the purpose of the site.
* Recognise and Respond Page: Focuses on warning signs and actionable tips.
* Get Help and Support Page: Includes resources, contact information, and a reporting form.
4. Feature Planning
Features were chosen to support the user journey and enhance the website's usability:
* A hero section with clear calls-to-action.
* Navigation bar for easy movement between pages.
* Bootstrap grids to organise information cleanly.
* Action buttons to encourage user engagement.
* A contact form for reporting concerns.
* Responsive design for optimal viewing on any device.

### Colors
For this project, I haveve chosen a colour palette of lime green, Prussian Blue, White, and a hint of Light Grey. Visually striking but also evoke feelings of safety and trust while subtly referencing law enforcement without being overwhelming.  Lime green and Prussian blue create a striking contrast, while white and light grey provide balance, giving the site a clean and professional feel.

### Fonts
Anton: Perfect for titles and headings due to its bold, impactful style. It draws attention and conveys authority, fitting for a website about a serious subject like PREVENT.
Inter: A versatile and highly readable font for body text. Its modern, clean lines complement Anton while ensuring the content remains approachable and digestible.

### Imagery
2D Flat Design: Using AI-generated flat illustrations in your color scheme ensures inclusivity and neutrality. The mix of male and female characters and non-specific racial representation is a thoughtful choice, ensuring no group feels excluded or targeted.
Consistency: The strong theme of lime green, Prussian blue, and black in the images ties them seamlessly into the website's design.
